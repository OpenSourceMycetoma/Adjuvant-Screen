To whom it may concern, We are a collective of researchers working in an open-source matter to discover potential pharmacological interventions for a neglected tropical disease known as eumycetoma. 

One of our current subprojects is to identify natural and semi-synthetic compounds (including aroma-compounds such as cinnamyl derivatives) as potential adjuvants for the treatment of this neglected condition. 

Our group is interested in procuring samples of the compounds listed below for use in an in-vitro assay to evaluate efficacy against eumycetoma causing fungi:

Galaxolide 
Calone 1951 (as powder)
Javanol
Ambrettolide
Maritima
Ambroxan (as powder)
Habanolide
Globanone 
Fructalate
Scentenal
Bisabolene
Indolarome
Hexadecanolide

Anywhere from 250 milligrams to 1 gram of the powdered products and 1 to 2 ml of the liquid products are suitable for the assay work.

We request that these products not contain any diluents or solvents as that may interfere with the screening process. 

We are reaching out to your company to see if you would be able to provide and ship the molecules on the above list Pro bono publico to our main research facility in the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands:

All data will be public accesss and should these compounds be used in any research paper MycetOS will thank your company for the generous gift in the research paper. 

The adress of our main research facility is as follows:
